The organization can invest in 1 or more of these plants subject to the availability of the fund. The different possible alternatives, their investment and present worth of returns are given following. Find the optimal allocation of capital to different plant which will maximize corresponding sum of present worth of return. 

 Plant 1: [alternate 1, cost - 0, return - 0], [alternate 2, cost - 1, return - 15], [alternate 3, cost - 2, return - 18], [alternate 4, cost - 4, return - 28]; 

 Plant 2: [alternate 1, cost - 0, return - 0], [alternate 2, cost - 2, return - 14], [alternate 3, cost - 3, return - 18], [alternate 4, cost - 4, return - 21];

 Plant 3: [alternate 1, cost - 0, return - 0], [alternate 2, cost - 1, return - 3], [alternate 3, cost - 2, return - 7].

**2) PRODUCT ALLOCATION PROBLEM.**

A company has 8 salesmen, who have to be allocated to four marketing zones. The return of profit from each zone depends upon the number of salesmen working that zone.
